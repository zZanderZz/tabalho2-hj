        <p>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter (GRAW) is a tactical shooter video game released for the Xbox 360, Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows in 2006. As in previous Ghost Recon games, players command their team while neutralizing
            hostile forces and completing various mission objectives. These objectives can range from escorting friendly units across the map to rescuing hostages or taking out enemy artillery. The game places emphasis on using cover effectively in order
            to stay alive, together with sound strategic co-ordination to successfully complete mission objectives. A new feature is the Integrated Warfighter System, a system based upon the Future Force Warrior program. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced
            Warfighter 2, the game's direct sequel, was released a year later in 2007. The Xbox 360 version was released for Xbox One backwards compatibility in 2018.</p>
